Introduction:
The goal of this website is to create a location where I can express some of the projects I enjoy working on when not in school or work.
Many, if not most of the project on this site were inspired by coders online. Coders who I've never met and probably will never meet
but to whom I am forever grateful. It is these members of the open source community that gave me a love of coding and exposed me to
the power one can have with code and also the joy it can bring someone. This website has been an outlet for me to reclaim the joy I have
for coding.
