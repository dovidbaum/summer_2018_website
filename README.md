# Dovid's Summer 2018 Website
http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~dbaum/summer_2018_website/index.html


## About the site 
The goal of this website is to create a location where I can express some of the projects I enjoy working on outside of school and work.
Many, if not most of these projects are inspired by coders online. These coders I've never met and probably will never meet
but to whom I am forever grateful. It is these members of the open source community that gave me a love of coding and exposed me to
the power and joy coding can bring.

## Bugs and Improvements to be had 
* Frogger needs to be fixed for mobile screens. 
    * arrow keys only display correctly on localhost, on top right as oppose to bottom right  
    * Canvas takes unique style versus localhost 
    * You Win! screen is off centered 
    * screen freezes when get jit on mobile screen, create a restart button after you fix arrow keys       
* Shortest path Randomize button reloads the entire page, have it just reload the Canvas.    
* Frogger page style is overridden and therefore not consistent with the rest of the website.     
* Playlist app barely works on mobile.    
* Playlist app needs to be taken to the next level as I get more familiar with with React.    
    * List all songs in a playlist but in a scrollbar.    
* Implement about page.  
* Post personaldrawings on Drawing page.
